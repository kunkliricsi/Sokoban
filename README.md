# Sokoban in C

This is the first *bigger* project I've made as a school assignment for my University.

Sokoban is a game where you push blocks around into given positions in order to solve the level. This is a representation of that game written in C. 
Although it's a console application its pretty graphical.

*//TODO: upload screenshots of the game.*

After loading the **Main Menu**, you can choose from the menu points below:
  - **About**: prints out the how-to and the credits section.
  - **Load Game**: continues the game from the last saved checkpoint. Only one game can be saved at once.
  - **New Game**: starts a new game. Overrites the previously saved game.
  - **Options**: prints out an options page, where you can set different settings like the theme of the game. Which essentially changes the color and characters of different blocks.
  - **Map Creator**: from here on you are able to load and play a user created map, or create a different map, which will override the previously created map.
  - **Exit**: *gives you $10.000 in cash*, what else would it do? :D
